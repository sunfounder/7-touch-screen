no radiation, etc. It is small, easy to use, and secure. The display applies to computer, Raspberry Pi devices, portable display and so on. It is suitable for the Raspberry 
Pi 3 model B/B+ and 4 Model B, and has the 1024Ã—600 physical resolution. The resolution is adjustable within the range 640Ã—480~1920Ã—1200. Ideal for applications like retro gaming, industrial control, as a secondary monitor, in home automation, for 3D printing control, and as a |link_pc_monitor|.
